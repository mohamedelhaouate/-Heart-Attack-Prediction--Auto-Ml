Dataset:
We utilized a comprehensive dataset comprising various health-related features such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other relevant indicators. The dataset was obtained from reputable medical sources and included a mix of patients with and without a history of heart attacks.

AutoML Workflow:
The project employed an AutoML workflow to automate the traditionally complex and time-consuming steps in model development. This included automated feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, model selection, and evaluation. The goal was to make the process accessible to those without extensive machine learning expertise while maintaining high predictive accuracy.


Model Evaluation:
AutoML algorithms were set to work, exploring various machine learning models and hyperparameter combinations. The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The emphasis was not only on predictive accuracy but also on creating a model that is easily interpretable for healthcare professionals.

Results:
The AutoML-driven model demonstrated remarkable predictive performance, accurately identifying individuals at risk of a heart attack. The streamlined workflow allowed for rapid experimentation and optimization, leading to an efficient and effective predictive tool.

Interpretability and Transparency:
One of the key advantages of the AutoML approach was the ability to generate interpretable models. This is critical in healthcare applications, where understanding the factors contributing to predictions is essential for medical professionals to make informed decisions.
